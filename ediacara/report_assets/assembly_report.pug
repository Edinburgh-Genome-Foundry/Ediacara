h2 Appendix

p.
  Each chapter describes results on a plasmid sequence (<i>de novo</i> assembly).
  The provided (part) sequences were aligned against the sequence assembled from the reads.
  The plot shows alignment regions as annotations. If an assembly plan is provided,
  then annotations are coloured based on whether they are expected in the plasmid: 
  green: parts is expected in the construct; red: parts shouldn't be in the construct.
  Grey is the reference expected sequence for the plasmid.
  The columns of the alignment table are:
   <ul>
    <li>Name: Query sequence name</li>
    <li>Length: Query sequence length</li>
    <li>Start: Query start coordinate</li>
    <li>End: Query end coordinate</li>
    <li>Strand: `+` if query and target on the same strand; `–` if opposite</li>
    <li>T Start: Target start coordinate on the original strand</li>
    <li>T End: Target end coordinate on the original strand</li>
    <li>Matches: Number of matching bases in the mapping (includes mismatches but not indels)</li>
    <li>Size: Number bases, including gaps (indels), in the mapping</li>
    <li>Quality: Mapping quality (0–255 with 255 for missing)</li>
  </ul>
